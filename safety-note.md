## Basekart Safety Notes

 **Contacting Sellers**
 Meet in Public: Whenever possible, meet the seller in a public, well-lit location. Avoid secluded areas for your safety.  
- Inspect the Item: Before making any payment, carefully inspect the item you're interested in. Verify its condition and authenticity.  
- Cashless Transactions: Consider using our app's secure payment options to avoid carrying large amounts of cash.  
- Share Responsibly: Refrain from sharing personal information or financial details with the seller.  
- Trust Your Instincts: If a deal seems too good to be true or makes you feel uncomfortable, it's okay to walk away.  
- Remember, we care about your safety. Report any suspicious activity or concerns to our support team immediately.
